# Hello friends,

 ### So yeah its a clone of netflix, except that it only has the fun stuff.
 ### Build with  love and React.js.
 
 ## The problem still not fixed:Â 
 - on preview exit to sides, sometimes does not recognize next movie hover.
 - Also should deff deconstruct the code a fair amount, bit bulky now since I got carried away in the frenzy of building.
