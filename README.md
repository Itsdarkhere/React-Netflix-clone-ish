# Hello friends,

 ## So yeah its a clone of netflix, I essentially only included the stuff I felt would be challenging/fun to build.
 ###  (Scroll with the half movies in the sides, video preview on long hover, and bunch of smaller details)
 ## Build with  love and React.js.
 
 ## The problem still not fixed:Â 
 - on preview exit to sides, sometimes does not recognize next movie hover.
